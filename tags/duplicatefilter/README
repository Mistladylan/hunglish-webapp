INSTALLALION INSTRUCTIONS

=================

1. Run ant.

=================

2. Softlink or copy the raw data to its place.

For example, on kruso.mokk, you can do this:
ln -s /big1/Language/Hungarian/Bicorp/TCOM data/TCOM
ln -s /public/Language/Hungarian/Bicorp/Hunglish data/Hunglish

On a home computer, you can do this :
cd data
wget -r ftp://ftp.mokk.bme.hu/Language/Hungarian/Bicorp/Hunglish

=================

3. Edit the indexer config file as needed.

The two most important tags in the quite-readable indexer config file are collection and index-dir.
collection specifies a bunch of data that should be indexed.
index-dir tells the system where to put the indexed database.

For convenience, we provide two example configs:
conf/indexer.conf indexes the Hunglish and TCOM corpora.
conf/indexertest.conf indexes the mag (newspaper) subcorpus of the Hunglish corpus. This takes minutes instead of hours as in the case of indexer.conf .
Both are set to build the index in ./index .

=================

4. Empty the index directory.

Remove the CVS directory (and any other directories) from the index directory. Lucene wants this to be empty.

=================

5. Run the indexer.

The

./index.sh conf/indexertest.conf conf/logger.xconf 

command should work fine at this point.

=================

6. Query the indexed corpus.

The

./search.sh conf/searcher.conf conf/logger.xconf

command puts you into a simple command prompt. First enter the Hungarian part of the query, press Enter, enter the English part.
(Typically one of the two will be the empty string.) The script should return the first ten query results.

=================

7. Install Hunglish as a Tomcat module.
